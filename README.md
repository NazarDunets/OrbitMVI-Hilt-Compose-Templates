# OrbitMVI+Hilt+Compose Templates for Android Studio

AI completions are nice but tempates are free, never hallucinate
and work faster. Repo contains 2 folders for 2 templates
respectively: just the ViewModel and ViewModel + Screen Composable.

Tempates can be added in Settings > Editor > File and Code Templates
